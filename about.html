      I have also worked as a consulting Data Scientist with experience in 
      the insurance industry, investment banking, website tagging and  
      performance analytics, serving in supporting roles and as a technical lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      I graduated Summa Cum Laude with a BS in Mathematics from Concordia University Texas, where I was inducted 
      into the National College Athlete Honor Society as a goalkeeper on the Men's Soccer team.
      I hold a Master of Science in Applied Analytics from Columbia University, where I graduated with the Distinguished
